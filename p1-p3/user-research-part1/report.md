### Research Method 
# A way to gather insights about Flinders students is to conduct surverys across the campus to have the studentds share about skills and request in ways that would motivate the student to use FUSS. in addition to doing surveys, interviewing students across the the science, arts and engieerning colleges to really focus and understand the pain points. although these options are interavtive, a less interactive way of getting infomation is going through competitor analysis such as facebook marketplace, gumtree, fiverr and uni peer support services.
