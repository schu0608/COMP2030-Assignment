## Competitor Analysis
### 1. Timebanking
#### Key Features:
- Members earn one “Time Credit” for each hour of service provided.
- Skills/services offered include tutoring, gardening, transport help, companionship, etc.
- Search and browse for services by category or location.
- Simple credit transfer after service completion.
#### Strengths:
- Proven model: Timebanking has been used successfully worldwide.
- Community focus: Builds strong local support networks.
- Simple and accessible: Clear process (1 hour = 1 credit), easy for users to grasp.
#### Weaknesses:
- Limited scope: Services are broad, but not tailored to students’ academic/non-academic needs.
- Interface usability: Some Timebanking platforms have outdated UI, which discourages regular use.
- Weak peer review: Basic review/feedback system, less detailed than what students might expect.

### 2. Skillshare 
#### Key Features:
- Video-based courses created by peers/experts.
- Community discussions and feedback under courses.
- Recommendations based on learning history.
- Subscription-based revenue model (not credits).
#### Strengths:
- Polished UX/UI: Clean, professional, and intuitive design.
- Peer-driven learning: Similar to FUSS’s concept of peer-to-peer exchange, but via structured lessons.
- Discovery features: Strong recommendation engine for finding relevant courses.
#### Weaknesses:
- Paid access: Requires subscription, not free or reciprocal like FUSS.
- One-directional: Students are primarily “consumers” of skills, not reciprocal providers.
- Less personal interaction: Interaction is mainly via comments, not real-time collaboration.

### 3. Facebook/Discord Groups
#### Key Features:
- Peer-to-peer posts for offers/requests
- Informal negotiation via comments or direct messages.
- Reviews/reputation handled socially.
- Large range of academic and non-academic support.
#### Strengths:
- Low barrier of entry: Students already use these platforms, no extra sign-up needed.
- Flexible: Anything can be requested/offered with no rigid structure.
#### Weaknesses:
- No structured credit system: Exchanges usually require money, not time/credits.
- Trust & safety issues: No guarantees on reliability, service completion, or fairness.
- Poor discoverability: Searching through posts is messy compared to structured filters/search.
